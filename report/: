\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:intro}
At \ac{uma} there is a robot intended to be used in helping the elderly if they have fallen on the floor.
% introducera OpenPose
\openpose is an 2D pose estimator that is focused on localization and classification of body parts in an image or a video clip.
Developed by Carnegie Mellon University~\ref{qiao2017openpose}.
% In their approach, they are set on using \openpose to find and assist the elderly.



% Thus it is relevant to investigate how \openpose reacts if an elderly human is lying on the ground.
% robot is used to either assist or pick them up.
%In this thesis, an investigation to how OpenPose
% The problem is that OpenPose only seems to be trained on datasets where humans are standing, sitting, walking and running.

% Later, that was proven to be unsolvable due to a cumulative error when traversing the nodes.

% \subsection{Hypothesis and research questions}%
% \label{sub:Hypothesis}
% The hypothesis for this job is that \openpose can not correctly identify the features of humans lying on the floor from certain angles.
% Thus, the hypothesis for this part of the work is:
% \vspace{5mm}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item[$\mathbf{H_0}$] The standard deviation of \openpose is on pair with a human from all angles.
%     \item[$\mathbf{H_a}$] The standard deviation of \openpose significantly deviates at certain angles.
% \end{itemize}

% \vspace{5mm}
% \raggedright Research questions used to prove the hypothesis above.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item[$\mathbf{Q_{1}}$] How does the accuracy of \openpose change as the camera is moving to a position where the subject is upside down?
%     \item[$\mathbf{Q_2}$] How does \aruco handle multiple fiducial markers in one image?
%     % \item[$\mathbf{Q_3}$]
% \end{itemize}

%       \caption{
%                       In this figure, the subject is on its back facing upward and from the for angles in the figure the two features marked as $F_{sr}$, $F_{er}$ for right shoulder and elbow respectively.
%           In the last image, its proposed the elbow can not be found from that camera angle thus not marked.
%           The \arucos  corner at the head is the origin for the system with corner 0.
%           Also for the last image, the camera cannot observe the origin, but as each other \arucos  corners is observed from the other angle, the camera position can still be calculated from the other \arucos  corners.

% \subsection{Expected outcome}%
% \label{sub:expected_outocem}
% The expected outcome from this work is a dataset that contains the following data.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Several sets each containing images of one subject on the ground.
%     \item In each set, there are several images from several angles.
%     \item 2D annotated data from the photos using both a human and \openpose
%     \item 3D pose cloud, estimated from each feature from human data and \openpose
% \end{itemize}

% % In this proposal, the data is proposed to be stored as CSV and YAML  files.
% % The CSV data contains the 2D pose for each set of images, while the YAML file contains settings for that set of data.

% The figure~\ref{fig:intro:dataset} contains a supposed set of images from the dataset with two notable features in the image.
